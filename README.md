# neurodiversity-checklists
Checklists and guides to help neurodivergent people navigate the workplace and ensure they get the support and help that they need to be successful as well as ensure they have the same opportunities that their neurotypical peers have.


## Overview
This list was derived from a TikTok video that my wife had discovered and she adapted it into this PDF format you can find here:

- [Neurodiversity_Accommodations_Checklist.pdf](https://github.com/rainmana/neurodiversity-checklists/blob/main/Neurodiversity_Accommodations_Checklist.pdf)


I have added a markdown version as well and will updated it with checkboxes/other formatting to make it match it's PDF countererpart better, but it should allow someone to create their own version more easily and not require a PDF viewer:

- [Neurodiversity_Accommodations_Checklist.md](https://github.com/rainmana/neurodiversity-checklists/blob/main/Neurodiversity_Accommodations_Checklist.md)


I have used the PDF version for my own accomodations at my various employers and it seems to work very well, so I wanted to make sure this was out in the public domain/hosted somewhere people could point to and use it! If you have any suggestions, please let me know or submit a pull request to suggest/make edits! I think a machine-readable format may be helpful and I will work on creating one of those as well!
